# 🏧 Microprocessor ATM Simulator

This project simulates an **ATM system** using **8086 Assembly language**.

## 🧠 Description
The program demonstrates ATM operations such as:
- PIN verification
- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal
- Simple transaction logic

It is written in Assembly (`atm.asm`) and can be executed using an 8086 emulator like **EMU8086** or **MASM**.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open `atm.asm` in EMU8086 or MASM.
2. Assemble and run the program.
3. Follow on-screen prompts for ATM operations.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- 8086 Microprocessor Assembly
- EMU8086 Simulator
